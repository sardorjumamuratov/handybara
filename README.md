Handybara comes in very handy in following situations:

ðŸ¤™ If you are living with someone and always checks on what is missing on the fridge by calling your partners. Imagine if they cannot answer your calls, what do you do then? ðŸ«¤

ðŸ›’ If you want to have a checklist of groceries before doing shopping, you can just list them here instead of writing them down on paper and carrying them around. Not only paper, but pen/pencil as well. Ugh! ðŸ¥µ

Have fun using it!
